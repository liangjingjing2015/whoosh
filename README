Whoosh is an ARM Linux bootloader forked from arm-kernel-shim aimed to be really
small and fast.

The ultimate goal of the projet is to be a repository of various bootloader
designed to be fast. It is not aiming at being generic or flexible.

For now, whoosh supports Freescale i.mx53 and i.mx6x platforms.

To build:
=========

$ make <board>_config
$ make

A script is provided to help building the final bootloader + kernel image and
flash it on an SDcard. Run it from the root directory of whoosh :

$ make <board>_config
$ ./script/FSL.sh -k <path to kernel Image or zImage> -m <path to mkimage> [<mmcdevice>]
